# Get Check Ins

## Contract and rule authority

The contract below describes an existing app/backend capability; canonical intended constraints are owned by [[Brain_Architecture#Global instruction precedence]], [[Data_Access#Authenticated identity and access]], [[Data_Boundary#Data truth precedence]], [[Data_Boundary#Action confirmation]], [[Response_Principles#Request-specific sufficiency and deliver-first]], [[Free_Pro_Entitlements#Entitlement matrix]], [[Companion_Mode#Trainer ownership]], [[Trainer_Approval_Model#Trainer suggests, trainer approves]], [[Safety#Research statement and professional review]], [[Crisis_Handling#Terminal safety path]] and [[Athlete_Profile#Confirmed equipment]].

Current implementation limitations do not override those owners. A generic trainer greeting is independent of client selection; athlete-specific operations still require authorization. No absent ledger, memory, medical-clearance inference or autonomous model tool is promised.

# Get Check Ins

## Purpose

Read dated self-reports newest first.

## When RYX Uses It

Analyze weekly reflection/adherence/recovery from supplied records.

## Inputs

Self userId, optional limit (route default20/max50); authorized snapshot for trainer client.

## Output

items; snapshot supplies up to 30.

## Permissions

Authenticated actor only; supplied userId must match the actor. Connected trainers read another athlete through the checked snapshot, not the legacy self-service route.

## Constraints

Displayed 4 Free/12 Pro, trends only on Pro formatter; missing values are not zero.

## Failure Behaviour

400 invalid/missing userId; 401/403 permission failure; no records remains an empty list.

## Implementation Source

GET /api/ryx/checkins; listCheckins.

This is an app/backend capability. The inspected chat model has no registered function-calling tools; it may explain/request a user action but cannot invoke this autonomously.

## Release and runtime boundary

Canonical intended rule for the v0.2.0 candidate. Production runtime is not yet aligned with all approved decisions. Historical implementation and the original note text are preserved in [[MIGRATION_REVIEW]] and [[RYX_Brain_v0.1.0_Notes_Snapshot]].
