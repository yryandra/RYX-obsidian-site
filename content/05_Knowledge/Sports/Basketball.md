## Canonical interpretation and retained source

Canonical rule: [[Knowledge_System#Provenance and evidence]]; [[Knowledge_System#Future retrieval contract]]. Apply [[Brain_Architecture#Global instruction precedence]], [[Data_Boundary#Data truth precedence]], [[Pain_and_Injury#Active pain and clearance]] and [[Athlete_Profile#Confirmed equipment]] before using this lower-priority knowledge. Complete source payloads below remain unchanged; they do not create user facts or override safety/access/tier constraints.

## How to read this knowledge

A five-a-side invasion sport combining shooting, ball handling, passing, screening, spatial decision-making, jumping, acceleration, deceleration, and repeated high-intensity efforts.

Start with Scope, Quality Rules For Ryx and Safety And Escalation; then read the programming, nutrition, recovery and niche sections that fit the request. This migration retains the whole source, including material the current SESSION formatter omits/truncates. Original kb_id, claim_id, source_ids, evidence_strength, dates and safety caveats are preserved. The source's verification date has not been advanced and its scientific/rules claims have not been independently revalidated.

[[Knowledge_System]] explains selection and limits. [[Safety]] remains highest priority.

## Nutrition And Hydration

- **principles**:
  - Item 1:
    - **claim_id**: energy_availability
    - **statement**: Adequate energy availability supports adaptation, endocrine and bone health, immunity, and performance; screen for REDs risk when restriction, menstrual disturbance, recurrent injury, or performance decline appears.
    - **evidence_strength**: high
    - **applies_to**: healthy_adults
    - **last_verified**: 2026-07-28
    - **source_ids**:
      - IOC_REDS_2023
  - Item 2:
    - **claim_id**: protein
    - **statement**: For most exercising adults, about 1.4-2.0 g/kg/day protein is sufficient; higher intakes may help preserve lean mass during energy restriction.
    - **evidence_strength**: high
    - **applies_to**: healthy_adults
    - **last_verified**: 2026-07-28
    - **source_ids**:
      - ISSN_PROTEIN_2017
  - Item 3:
    - **claim_id**: carbohydrate
    - **statement**: Scale carbohydrate to training volume and intensity; higher-intensity and longer-duration work generally requires more carbohydrate.
    - **evidence_strength**: high
    - **applies_to**: healthy_adults
    - **last_verified**: 2026-07-28
    - **source_ids**:
      - (empty array)
  - Item 4:
    - **claim_id**: hydration
    - **statement**: Begin adequately hydrated and individualize fluid and sodium using environment, sweat rate, session duration, and tolerance; avoid both excessive dehydration and forced overdrinking.
    - **evidence_strength**: high
    - **applies_to**: healthy_adults
    - **last_verified**: 2026-07-28
    - **source_ids**:
      - (empty array)
  - Item 5:
    - **claim_id**: supplements
    - **statement**: Food, training, and sleep come first. Evidence is strongest for context-appropriate use of creatine, caffeine, beta-alanine, nitrate, and protein; screen health, dose, side effects, and anti-doping contamination.
    - **evidence_strength**: moderate
    - **applies_to**: healthy_adults
    - **last_verified**: 2026-07-28
    - **source_ids**:
      - SUPPLEMENTS_2024
      - ISSN_CREATINE_2017
- **anti_doping**: Use only products permitted by the applicable rules and prefer independently batch-tested supplements; RYX must never guarantee a supplement is contamination-free.

## Recovery

- **sleep**: Target a consistent schedule and usually 7-9 hours for adults, often more for youth or high training loads; individual need varies.
- **active_recovery**: Low-intensity activity may improve perceived recovery but does not replace sleep, nutrition, or load management.
- **deload**: Use a planned or responsive reduction in volume and/or intensity when accumulated fatigue masks fitness or before priority competition.

## Safety And Escalation

- **emergency**:
  - chest_pain
  - fainting
  - severe_breathlessness
  - signs_of_heat_stroke
  - suspected_spinal_injury
  - severe_allergic_reaction
  - stroke_signs
- **urgent_clinical_review**:
  - suspected_concussion
  - inability_to_bear_weight
  - visible_deformity
  - rapid_swelling
  - neurological_symptoms
  - dark_urine_after_extreme_exertion
  - persistent_night_pain
- **coaching_boundary**: RYX may educate and adjust general training, but must not diagnose injury, clear return to sport, prescribe medication, or override a clinician.
- **concussion_rule**: Remove from play immediately when concussion is suspected; no same-day return; use qualified medical assessment and a graduated return process.

## Quality Rules For Ryx

- Ask only questions that materially change the recommendation.
- State assumptions and confidence when data are missing.
- Separate rule, consensus, common practice, and emerging evidence.
- Never present correlation, tradition, or elite practice as proof of causation.
- Provide regressions, progressions, and stop criteria with exercise advice.
- Use metric units and optionally show imperial equivalents.
- For minors, pregnancy, chronic disease, eating-disorder risk, or post-injury return, apply stricter escalation.

  - jumps_or_strokes
  - competition_minutes
- **internal**:

- **rule**: Use rolling individual baselines and context. No single workload ratio or wearable metric proves injury risk.

## Return To Sport

Use criterion-based, shared decision-making: clinical recovery, capacity, sport-specific function, psychological readiness, progressive training exposure, and clinician clearance where required.

## Skill Models

- **shooting**:
  - balance_and_alignment
  - repeatable_ball_path
  - release
  - arc_and_depth
  - footwork_into_shot
  - representative_contest
  - shot_selection
- **ball_handling**:

  - both_hands
  - pace_and_angle_change
  - protect_ball
  - decision_after_advantage
- **finishing**:

  - floater
  - reverse
  - kickout_read
- **defense**:
  - stance

  - closeout
  - screen_navigation
  - help_position
  - rebound_finish

## Training

- **constraints_led**: Design drills with defenders, scoring rules, space, time, and numerical advantage that preserve the information in games.
- **shooting_volume**: Track makes and context, not only attempts. Quality drops under excessive fatigue; distribute high-quality practice.
- **physical**:
  - strength_2_to_3_weekly_in_development
  - landing_and_deceleration
  - ankle_calf_capacity
  - hamstring_and_adductor
  - jump_dose_monitoring
  - conditioning_by_role
- **in_season**: Maintain strength/power with lower volume, manage game/minute congestion, and give low-minute players development top-ups.

## Injury Risk

- **common**:
  - ankle_sprain
  - patellar_tendon
  - knee_or_ACL
  - low_back
  - finger_hand
  - concussion
- **prevention**:
  - neuromuscular_warmup
  - strength
  - landing_deceleration
  - ankle_support_when_indicated
  - progressive_jump_load

## Rules

- **authority**: FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2024, effective 1 October 2024
- **core**:
  - 2_teams_of_5
  - 4x10_min_FIBA
  - 24_second_clock
  - 8_second_backcourt
  - 3_second_lane
  - fouls_and_free_throws
- **warning**: NBA, WNBA, NCAA, youth, and local rules differ; ask which ruleset applies.
